__Basic Environment Configuation (Windows or Linux, the specific installation time depends on your system configuration):__
* Python 3.9.18
* Pytorch 1.12.1

* Pytorch Geometric (PyG) for PyTorch 1.12.* and CUDA 11.3
* Pytorch-scatter 2.1.0

## Steps about how to generate required data for model pre-training and model downstream predictions ##

__Step1. Generating the coarse-grained (CG) protein files as the initial input of MCGLPPI.__

1. No matter for the pre-training phase or the downstream prediction phase, the framework requires the geometric parameters generated by MARTINI2 (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ct700324x) or MARTINI3 (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01098-3) for each sample as the input.

2. As MCGLPPI focuses on the general protein-protein interaction (PPI) complex overall property prediction tasks, the explicit specification of two interaction parts for each original PDB complex file (as a sample point) is required. This can be easily achieved by specifying the chain id of each atom line to A (i.e., interaction part A) or B (i.e., interaction part B) in the PDB file based on the prior knowledge. 



## Quick start ##

__We have provided:__ 

__(1) our pre-processed CG source data pickle file (in downstream_files/PDBBIND),__

__(2) pre-trained CG graph encoder (in pretrained_cgmodels, below is the checkpoint name),__

cgdiff_seed0_gamma0.2_bs64_epoch50_dim256_length150_radius5_extra_step2_0_ls3did_fepoch200_bbfeatsFalse_miFalse.pth

__(3) corresponding running script demos (based on the PDBbind) for a quick start.__ 

__Please follow the illustration in config/ppi_cg/cg_pdbbind_gearnet_gbt.yaml to set the hyper-parameters for the downstream evaluation configurations (supporting both training-from-scratch or fine-tuning from the pre-trained checkpoint).__

__A running example (including the training and evaluation to create the similar results reported):__

__After the environment configuration, usually several hours are needed to finish running the demo code. The evaluation results might be varying according to the actual installed virtual environment and the supporting hardware.__

python cg_steps/cg_downstream_1gpu_10CV_GBT.py -c config/ppi_cg/cg_pdbbind_gearnet_gbt.yaml  

(whether to use the pre-trained CG graph encoder checkpoint can be directly specified by the 'model_checkpoint' argument in above yaml file, if not, excuating training-from-scratch)

__The complete MCGLPPI framework, including the CG geometer parameter generation code, CG pre-training scripts, evaluation scripts of other downstream datasets, all mentioned source data files, and other supporting scripts/materials will be released upon acceptance.__
